# 🚀 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## Current Status

✅ **Documentation files are ready** in this folder:
- START_HERE.md
- QUICK_START.md
- README.md
- INDEX.md
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md
- INSTALLATION.txt
- package.json
- .env (empty - needs your credentials)
- .env.example
- .gitignore

❌ **Source code files need to be created**

## Option 1: Download Complete Project (RECOMMENDED)

I'll create a ZIP file with all the source code. 

**ALTERNATIVE**: Since the source files were created but are in the wrong location,
let me help you get them properly.

## Option 2: Manual File Creation

I can provide you with each file's content one by one, and you can create them manually.

## Option 3: Use the Generator Script

Run the PowerShell script I'll create that contains all the source code embedded.
